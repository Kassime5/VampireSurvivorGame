## Vampire Survivor Like Game

Goal of this project is to create a game similar to Vampire Survivor using the Godot Engine.

The principal idea is to create a game where the player has to survive waves of enemies, leveling up and getting stronger as the game progresses.

Power Ups are also available to help the player in the fight against the enemies.

For now, only one playable character is available, with one type of enemy.

### Asset Credits
